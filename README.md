Will update as I get further into the project, but essentially, trying to get my Flash Prototype version of the aspect into a client/server instance with this as the front-end.

Mainly looking to try and use a more newer javascript framework - was originally planning to use Angular, but that might not be viable at this point, and it might be worth considering a separate one.
